# PlaylistTransferApp
Very simple and limited Playlist Transfer Application. Intended for playlist transferring between Apple Music and Spotify. More music platforms and better integration could be added later on the condition I am able to open a server for handling sensitive data. 

If running this application, must add Spotify developer token information. This can be found in SpotifyAuthManager.swift.

Apple Music implementation would require an Apple Developer account subscription, so instead I use the convert to txt option and txt to Apple Music options from TuneMyMusic. While this is not ideal, it is free.

Includes example files for testing formatting of playlists.
